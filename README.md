# Learning Redux
This is the code repository for [Learning Redux](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-redux?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786462398), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Managing an applications state is crucial for your application to behave consistently and this is where Redux comes into the picture. It provides a state container for applications. This book gives in-depth information on Redux and third party tools needed for a developer to build a robust modern web application in React.

The book shows you how to solve common problems in web development such as user authentication and interfacing with third party APIs using Redux. Furthermore, you will see how solve problems with state management such as undo and redo through higher-order reducers and extending Redux via middleware.

The book starts with a short introduction to the principles and the ecosystem of Redux, then moves on to show how to implement the basic elements of Redux and put them together. Afterwards, you are going to learn how to integrate Redux with other frameworks, such as React and Angular.

Along the way, you are going to develop a blog application. To practice developing growing applications with Redux, we are going to start from nothing and keep adding features to our application throughout the chapters.

You are going to learn how to integrate and use Redux DevTools to debug the application, and access external APIs with Redux. You are also going to get acquainted with writing tests for all elements of a Redux application. Afterwards, we are going to cover important concepts in web development, such as routing, user authentication and communication with a backend server.

After understanding how to use Redux and seeing how powerful its ecosystem can be, the book teaches you how to make your own abstractions on top of Redux, like higher-order reducers and middleware.

By the end of the book, you are going to be able to develop and maintain Redux applications with ease. In addition to learning about Redux, you are going be familiar with its ecosystem, and learn a lot about JavaScript itself, including best practices and patterns.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
  "title": "Another test",
  "text": "Hello API!"
}
```
